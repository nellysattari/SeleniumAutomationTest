# Automation Test Project:
The solution contains two projects. 
- Selenium.Framework (Pure Selenium tests)
- Test.Runner (VisualStudio UnitTesting to run and assert the results)
  
# Configuration: 
  This projects basically open a website and submit a request in contact page. 
  - So You need to set a real Email address in Test.Runner=> App.config => AppSetting =>Email  
  - If you want to change the URL later on, you need to amend the Appconfig=> URL as well
